positive: A middle-aged Asian man casually smoking a cigarette, taking slow deliberate
  puffs with natural hand movements. Smoke swirls realistically around his face as
  he exhales, with subtle facial expressions and occasional adjustments of the cigarette
  between his fingers. The scene has cinematic lighting with soft smoke trails.
negative: disappearing cigarette, cigarette leaving mouth, frozen frame, no smoke
  movement, cigarette stuck to lips, floating cigarettes, distorted fingers, unnatural
  hand gestures, smoke clipping through face, poor smoke physics, facial distortion,
  blurred details, low resolution, frame interpolation artifacts, missing facial features,
  smoke appearing/disappearing abruptly, jerky movements, unrealistic smoke density,
  cigarette merging with skin
